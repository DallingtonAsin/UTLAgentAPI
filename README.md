# UTLAgentAPI
C#, ASP.NET application programming interface (API) that receives requests from UTLAgent web portal to enable a Telecom(UTL) agent
to register a customer whose registration details are sent via email, deposit money on customer's account, withdraw money from customer's account,
view a list of all registered customers, view customer's account balance, view a ledger of transactions, 
check if customer is registered and view list of activity logs done within the system.
